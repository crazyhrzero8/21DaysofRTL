Design and verify a valid/ready based memory interface slave. The interface should be able to generate the ready output after a random delay. Memory should be 16x32 bits wide.

Interface Definition

Valid/ready protocol must be honoured

The module should have the following interface:

module day17 (

  input       wire        clk,

  input       wire        reset,

  input       wire        req_i,        -> Valid request input remains asserted until ready is seen

  input       wire        req_rnw_i,    -> Read-not-write (1-read, 0-write)

  input       wire[3:0]   req_addr_i,   -> 4-bit Memory address

  input       wire[31:0]  req_wdata_i,  -> 32-bit write data

  output      wire        req_ready_o,  -> Ready output when request accepted

  output      wire[31:0]  req_rdata_o   -> Read data from memory

);

  // Memory array

  logic [15:0][31:0] mem;
