Design and verify a 8-bit ALU which supports the following encoded operations:

Encoding	Operation	Comment 

3'b000	ADD	-

3'b001	SUB	-

3'b010	SLL	Vector a should left shift using bits 2:0 of vector b

3'b011	LSR	Vector a should right shift using bits 2:0 of vector b

3'b100	AND	-

3'b101	OR	-

3'b110	XOR	-

3'b111	EQL	Output should be 1 when equal otherwise 0

Interface Definition

The module should have the following interface:

input     logic [7:0]   a_i,  - First 8-bit input vector

input     logic [7:0]   b_i,  - Second 8-bit input vector

input     logic [2:0]   op_i, - Encoded operation

output    logic [7:0]   alu_o - ALU output

Challenge:
Try solving this problem which deals with designing the ALU for a RISC-V Processor.
