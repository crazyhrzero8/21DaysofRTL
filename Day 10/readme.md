Design and verify a counter which supports loading a value

Interface Definition

Counter should reset to 0

The module should have the following interface:

input     wire          clk, 

input     wire          reset, 

input     wire          load_i,     -> Load value is valid this cycle 

input     wire[3:0]     load_val_i, -> 4-bit load value

output    wire[3:0]     count_o     -> Counter output
