Serial Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a technique used to detect errors in data transmission over physical links. CRC is commonly used in digital networks and storage devices

Here's how CRC works:

The transmitter calculates a CRC value based on the data being transmitted. 

The transmitter appends the CRC value to the data and sends it.

The receiver decodes the CRC value and compares it to the received data.

If the CRC values match, the data was transmitted correctly. If they don't match, it indicates that errors occurred during transmission.

CRC can detect even single bit errors. The most common cause of CRC errors is a damaged or malfunctioning component of the physical link between two devices, such as a failing physical medium or transceivers.
